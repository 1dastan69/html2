    <font face="Times New Roman">A car is a road vehicle used to carry passengers.
        It is also called an automobile, which comes from the Greek word "auto" and the French word "mobile".
        This name means "self-moving", as cars do not need horses or other external sources of power to move.
        Cars usually have four wheels and get their power from an engine.
        Millions of cars were made during the 20th century.
