<h1>Dastan</h1>
<hr width="100%" />
<p>
    A dastan is generally centered on one individual who protects his tribe
    or his people from an outside invader or enemy,
    although only occasionally can this figure be traced back to a historical person.
    This main character sets an example of how one should act,
    and the dastan becomes a teaching tool â€” for example the Sufi master and
    Turkic poet Ahmet Yesevi said "Let the scholars hear my wisdom,
    treating my words like a dastan". Alongside the wisdom, each dastan is rich with cultural history of interest to scholars.
